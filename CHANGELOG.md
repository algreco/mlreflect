# Changelog

## [0.15.2] 2021-04-30

### Added

- Added more docstrings for new classes.

### Changed

- Moved all high-level imports from the `mlreflect` package to its respective sub-packages for a better structure.

### Fixed

- Fixed dependency issues during where requirements are already called before they are installed
- Added `packaging` module to the requirements

## [0.15.1] 2021-04-30

### Added

- Added `UniformNoiseGenerator` class
- Added `Trainer` and `TrainedModel` classes to simplify on-the-fly training
- Added a `default_trained_model.h5` package resource that contains a trained keras model to fit XRR of a single 
  layer on a Si/SiOx substrate in air/vacuum.
- Added `DefaultTrainedModel` subclass that automatically loads the default model.
- Added `CurveFitter` and `SpecFitter` classes for easier on-the-fly fitting.

### Changed

- Update example notebook

### Fixed

- Fixed small bug in `mlreflect.noise.apply_scaling_factor()`. Now it returns a copy of the data.

## [0.15.0] 2021-04-27

### Added

- Added the `Parameter` class and its subclasses to make the definition of `Layer` objects easier.
- `Parameter` objects can also be sampled to create random labels for training data generation.
- Added a `Layer` subclass `ConstantLayer` which can only contain fixed parameters (no ranges)
- Added two `ConstantLayer` subclasses `Substrate` and `AmbientLayer` which are now used to make `MultilayerStructure`
  objects.
- `Substrate` objects don't have a thickness.
- `AmbientLayer` objects only have an SLD.
- A `MultilayerStructure` object can now be exported to and read from a dictionary with the `to_dict()` and
  `from_dict()` methods.
- Added a `copy()` method to all `Layer` and `MultilayerStructure` classes.

### Changed

- `Layer` objects now initialize with `Parameter` objects instead of range tuples for each thin film parameter.
- `MultilayerStructure` objects are no longer initialized with the ambient layer SLD. Instead, the ambient layer and 
  substrate are defined with separate methods.
- The substrate and ambient layer are by default constant layers
- Moved the different sampling distribution for training label generation to a new module
  `data_generation.distributions`
- The optional parameter `q_noise_spread` of the `ReflectivityGenerator` class to simulate noisy _q_ values was 
  moved from the initializer to the `simulate_reflectivity()` method.
- Removed the option to remove non-constant labels from the training labels when using the `OutputPreprocessor` class, 
  because it was somewhat confusing and found little use.

## [0.14.1] 2020-08-4

### Changed

- Updated all docstrings to that they can be read by the documentation generator Sphinx (using the Napoleon extension
 for Google-style docstrings).

## [0.14.0] 2020-07-31

### Added

- Added unit tests files `test_layers.py`, `test_data_generator.py`, `test_noise_generator.py` and
 `test_preprocessing.py` as well as the test runner `runner.py`.
- Added functions to h5_tools module that can be used to save the noise and background generated with the `noise`
 module to the save h5 file
- Added `NoiseGenerator` class to `training.noise_generator` which allows dynamic noise and background generation during
 training.
- Added `InputPreprocessor` properties `has_saved_standardization`, `standard_mean`, `standard_std`.
- Added `naming` module with `make_timestamp()` function to create identifiers for training output.
- Added `check_gpu.py` script to be able to quickly check if tensorflow can find the GPU.

### Changed

- Slightly changed the API of `OutputPreprocessor.restore_labels()`. It now only takes a single argument (the
 normalized labels). 
- Refactor internal package structure of the package source.
- Cleaned up a lot of attributes and methods and turned them into properties.
- Improved `has_saved_standardization` property of the `InputPreprocessor` class (return value depends now on whether
 or not `standard_mean` and `standard_std` are `True` or `False`.)
- Improved `__repr__` of `Layer` and `MultilayerStructure` classes.
- Updated `usage_example.ipynb` to work with the new API.
 
### Fixed

- Fixed several inconsistency bugs of the `label_removal_list` feature of the `OutputPreprocessor` class (with the
 help of unit tests).
 - Background and noise levels can now also be of `int` type (previously only `float`).

## [0.13.1] - 2020-06-03

### Added

- Added option for the `noise` module to generate shot noise and backgrounds with random levels within a given range.

### Changed

- The thickness of the bottom most layer (substrate) is no longer a label, because it has no influence on the data
 generation process and its presence was confusing.

### Fixed

- Fixed bug where the roughness of the bottom most layer was dependent on its thickness (which in turn was always set
 to 1). This led to a substrate roughness that was confined between 0 and 0.5 Ã….

## [0.13.0] - 2020-04-22

### Added

- Added new C++-based reflectivity simulation engine from the refl1d package. This should be ~20 times faster than the
built-in code. The simulation engine can be chosen by using via the `engine` keyword of the ReflectivityGenerator class.
- Output normalization can now be changed from a [0, 1] range to a [-1, 1] range by choosing the approriate value for
the `normalization` keyword of the `OutputPreprocessor` class.
- Added method `InputPreprocessor.revert_standardization()`.

### Changed

- The ambient SLD is now also given as a range (instead of a single value) and can be used as a non-constant label for
training.
- `OutputPreprocessor.apply_preprocessing()` now returns a tuple containing preprocessed labels in addition to the
removed labels both as pandas DataFrames.
- The `removed_labels` DataFrame is now used to by the `restore_labels` method instead of the previous `training_labels`
DataFrame (which caused some confusion).
- Removed methods and properties too reduce overhead and limit inconsistencies.
- Changed the .h5 file format that is with the `h5_tools` module.
    - It is now no longer designed to save training, validation and testing data in separate groups to give the user
    more flexibility. As a result, the group hierarchy was reduced by one level ("data" group was removed).
    - All non-data information (units, min/max label values, etc.) have now been moved to the "info" group.
- Removed job list functionality from the `InputPreprocessor` class because it was unintuitive to use. Now the class is
only used for input standardization.
- Moved methods `apply_shot_noise()`, `generate_background()`, `apply_gaussian_convolution()` of the
`ReflectivityGenerator` class to a new `noise` module as stand-alone functions  that can be applied to any previously
generated reflectivity curves.
- `apply_gaussian_convolution()` now uses the gaussian convolution from the refl1d package.
- Updated example notebook `data/notebooks/usage_example.ipynb` to match API of version 0.13.0

### Fixed

- Non-constant labels that are removed via the `OutputPreprocessor` class are now not incorrectly added to the restored
labels anymore.
- Fixed that the wrong number of thin film layers was saved to the .h5 file when using the `h5_tools` module.
- The built-in reflectivity engine can now no longer generate intensities that are higher than 1.
